🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL REFACTORING IN PROGRESS 🚨🚨🚨

⚠️  URGENT: ALL DEVELOPMENT MUST FOLLOW REFACTOR ROADMAP
📋 PRIMARY DOCUMENT: CRITICAL_REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md

🔴 BLOCKING ISSUES:
- Monolithic 700+ line main_game.gd file
- 25+ memory leaks from direct new() calls  
- Orphaned systems (EventBus, Config, Components)
- Zero test coverage
- Broken project configuration

🎯 MISSION: Transform prototype → production-ready system
⏰ TIMELINE: 2-3 weeks maximum
🚀 STATUS: Revolution initiated - execution phase active

⚡ NEXT ACTIONS:
1. READ: CRITICAL_REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md
2. EXTRACT: TurnManager from main_game.gd
3. IMPLEMENT: ObjectPool integration
4. MIGRATE: Communication to EventBus

❌ DO NOT:
- Add code to main_game.gd
- Create objects with new() directly
- Ignore the roadmap
- Work without tests

✅ DO:
- Follow the roadmap strictly
- Use existing systems (Logger, Config, ObjectPool)
- Write tests for all new code
- Document architectural decisions

🎯 GOAL: Enterprise-grade game engine architecture
🔥 URGENCY: MAXIMUM - ALL HANDS ON DECK
