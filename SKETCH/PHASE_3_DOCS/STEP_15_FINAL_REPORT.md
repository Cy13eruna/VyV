# 🏁 STEP 15 COMPLETED - DRAWING SYSTEM EXTRACTION (FINAL STEP!)

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE ACHIEVED
**Successfully extracted visual rendering utilities and drawing functions from main_game.gd into a dedicated DrawingSystem - COMPLETING THE FULL DEMONOLITHIZATION!**

---

## 📊 RESULTS SUMMARY

### Files Created:
- ✅ `systems/drawing_system.gd` - 200+ lines of centralized drawing logic
- ✅ Updated `project.godot` with DrawingSystem autoload
- ✅ Created backup: `main_game_step_15_backup.gd`

### Functions Extracted:
- ✅ `draw_domains()` - Domain hexagon rendering
- ✅ `draw_domain_hexagon()` - Individual domain drawing
- ✅ `get_edge_length()` - Edge distance calculation
- ✅ `get_path_color()` - Path color determination
- ✅ `point_near_line()` - Line proximity detection
- ✅ `draw_background()` - Background rendering
- ✅ `draw_paths()` - Path visualization with fog logic
- ✅ `draw_points()` - Point rendering with visibility
- ✅ `render_complete_scene()` - Full rendering pipeline
- ✅ Debug utilities for grid visualization

### Integration Points:
- ✅ DrawingSystem initialization in `_ready()`
- ✅ State synchronization via `_update_drawing_system_state()`
- ✅ Fallback chain: DrawingSystem → TerrainSystem → Local
- ✅ All drawing calls updated to use DrawingSystem
